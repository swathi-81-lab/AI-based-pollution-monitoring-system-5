# AI-based-pollution-monitoring-system-5
This project uses Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques to monitor and predict pollution levels. The system processes environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, and air pollutants, and applies classification models to determine pollution levels for effective environmental monitoring and analysis.
